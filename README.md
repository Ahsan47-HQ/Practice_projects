# Practice_projects
Welcome to my Practice Projects repository.

I've learned that consistent practice is key to improving and expanding one’s skill set. This repo documents my journey through various mini-projects — regardless of whether they're one-day experiments or week-long builds.

The goal here isn’t perfection, but progress. I’ll continue to push updates and track my learning, because consistent effort and growth matter more than perfect results.
